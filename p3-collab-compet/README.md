# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

## Introduction

This project aims to train two agents controlling rackets to bounce a ball over a net.

## Understanding the environment

This environment is constructed using the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents), an open-source Unity plugin that allows games and simulations to function as environments for training intelligent agents. The project environment provided by Udacity closely resembles the Tennis environment found on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page, though it is not identical. In this environment, two agents control rackets to volley a ball over a net. When an agent successfully hits the ball over the net, it earns a reward of +0.1. Conversely, if an agent allows the ball to hit the ground or hits it out of bounds, it incurs a penalty of -0.01. The primary objective for each agent is to keep the ball in play.
