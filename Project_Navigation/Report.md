# Project Report

# Objective 

This project aims to train an agent using Deep Q Learning to navigate Unity's Banana Collector environment, where the task is to gather yellow bananas while avoiding blue ones. Employing a Deep Q Learning algorithm, the agent successfully mastered the environment in 786 DQN and 570 episodes of Dueling DQN.
