# Project 2: Continuous Control

## Introduction

This project aims to develop and train a double-jointed arm agent capable of keeping its hand in continuous contact with a moving target for the maximum number of time steps.

# Understanding the environment

This environment has been developed using the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents). This open-source Unity plugin allows games and simulations to function as environments for training intelligent agents. In this setting, a double-jointed arm can move to specified target locations. The agent receives a reward of +0.1 for each step that its hand remains within the goal location. Therefore, the agent's objective is to keep its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
